            <p> I've spend quite some time building this tool to automate and make the process of booking an appointment
                for GNIB and visa a little bit easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope this tool helped you find and book and appointment, saving time :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Please consider donating cup of coffee to me, so I could continue making improvements to it!
            </p>
